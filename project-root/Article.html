<h1 class="CenterIdea"> Is Generative AI Ethical to use in terms of academics?(ARTICLE) </h1>
<hr>
<h3 class="Q">Using an Analogy on the use of AI in Dev Work</h3>
<p class="Q">You are organizing your wedding, the documentation team is asking 40k for the wedding package. They will use an Iphone 16 pro max to cover the event and CapCut <br>for the same day edit video. The documentation team has 2 years of experience and has an above average portfolio. <br>Would you agree to that deal? Explain your answer and justify the integrity of their work. Reflect on the integrity, creativity, skill level of the “vibe” coders.
</p>
<img src="assets/images/AIROBOT.jpg" class="corner">
<p class="Q"> In my opinion, If we see the photographer using the sub-par tool like the iphone and uses capcut as the main editing program as the analogy for people abusing AI to gain money like "vibe"coders.<br>Then I see myself as getting ripped-off. Even with 2 years of experience and with 
an average portfolio. Having a wedding be documented via iphone and capcut is disrespect ful to the groom and bride.<br>
In words that relates to AI vibe coders, It like putting AI art with minimal human effort in museum with Da Vinci paintings. It's plain out disrespectful to the craft.<br></p>
<p class="Q">However, the use of AI as an  assitant to get out of creative block by use of suggestions. Like if you don't know how to make an ending and you ask AI how should you end a story. And the AI suggested <br>
make it a plot twist. It's fair game however, if the AI has a very specific suggestion you may infringed on a original idea due to how AI works. searching its data through the internet. All-in-all, AI can be used with only <br>
respect to ethical rule that has been said in the ethics part of this website.</p>
